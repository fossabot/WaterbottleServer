The Roblox HttpService unlocks so many potentials within your game or/and group. The newly created [``HttpService:RequestAsync()``](http://robloxdev.com/api-reference/function/HttpService/RequestAsync) function added in Version [0.343](https://anaminus.github.io/api/diff.html#v0.343) has made this project the most secure Roblox http server you can currently find as it allows authentication headers and so much more.

## How does it work?
The Roblox library [``Waterbottle``](https://github.com/WelpNathan/Waterbottle) contains API methods using secure functions to connect to the Waterbottle Server. Using this, it creates a powerful tool for group promotions, shouts and so much more. This project utilises high security methods using features such as [Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) but a simple setup to make your life a lot easier when developing on the platform.
